Salesforce Status Helper created by Drew Rutherford

Available on Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/salesforce-status-helper

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

Click your preferred Omni-Channel status. The chosen status will remain active until disabled. This is useful for when Omni-Channel disconnects you unexpectedly and without warning.

Every 15 seconds the extension will verify that you're still logged in with the selected status. If not, it will automatically sign you back in.

If the extension detects that you're 'On a Web Case' it will NOT change your status. You will have to manually change out of it first.

Every 60 seconds the extension will refresh Omni Supervisor to be sure the connection is in a healthy state.

NOTES:
- This will ONLY work in .salesforce.com or .force.com domains. If you try to set your status in another tab without these domains nothing will happen.
- If you don't have Omni Supervisor open in a Salesforce tab then an error will display in the console. More importantly you can enter in an error state that the extension can't detect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting:

If you open Web Developer Tools by either pressing 'F12' or by going into Settings > More Tools > Developer Tools you will see various console logs. Please use these logs to report any issues.

Features to come... maybe:

- Dropdown menu to select on-queue and backlog hours so that Status Helper will automatically sign you in and out as needed.
