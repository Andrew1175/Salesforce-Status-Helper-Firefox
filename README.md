Salesforce Status Helper created by Drew Rutherford

Available on Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/salesforce-status-helper

Description:

Click your preferred Omni-Channel status. The chosen status will remain active until disabled. This is useful for when Omni-Channel disconnects you unexpectedly and without warning.

Every 15 seconds the extension will verify that you're still logged in with the selected status. If not, it will automatically sign you back in.

If the extension detects that you're 'On a Web Case' it will NOT change your status. You will have to manually change out of it first.

Troubleshooting:

If you open Web Developer Tools by either pressing 'F12' or by going into Settings > More Tools > Web Developer Tools you will see console logs every 15 seconds indicating status health checks occurring.
NOTE: You will only see these health check messages if you have Available or Backlog enabled.

Features to come... maybe:

- Dropdown menu to select on-queue and backlog hours so that Status Helper will automatically sign you in and out as needed.
